# RCL-Phase-plane-analysis-and-Design-
The purpose of this project was construction of a phase-plane analysis for systems of differential equations. In the first part of the project I produced a phase plane for a given system. Then using ode45 I showed the trajectory solutions on the plot. Finally, I validated our solution using a linear system, a nonlinear system and the pendulum system.
